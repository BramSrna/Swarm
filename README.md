# Swarm
Repo for general swam development

# Use Case
1. User logs in through browser
2. User enters task bundle (tasks to execute, how many bots per task, any output or logs to measure)
3. Bots in swarm execute tasks
4. User can monitor execution
5. User notified when task execution complete


Task execution
* Collaboration on tasks
* Task Optimization
* Emergent behaviour
* Self replication + improvement

## Milestones
### Milestone 1 (Centralized task distribution)
1. Swarm manager receives tasks
2. Swarm manager creates execution groups of bots to executes tasks and distributes the tasks to the bots
3. Bots in execution group connect together and execute the task
4. On task completion, the bots disconnect from each other

### Milestone 2 (Decentralized version of milestone 1)
1. Swarm manager receives tasks
2. Swarm manager distributes tasks to all bots
3. Bots form and tear down groups as needed
