# Swarm
Repo for general swarm development

Task execution
* Collaboration on tasks
* Task Optimization
* Emergent behaviour
* Self replication + improvement

## Iterations
### Iteration 1 (Collaboration on tasks, Task Optimization)
1. Swarm manager receives tasks
2. Swarm manager creates execution groups of bots to executes tasks and distributes the tasks to the bots
3. Bots in execution group connect together, execute, and optimize the task
4. On task completion, the bots disconnect from each other

### Iteration 2 (Emergent behaviour, Self replication + improvement)
1. Execution group can create new tasks while executing a task bundle

### Iteration 3 (Self replication + improvement)
1. Task framework built up in previous iterations

### Potential Areas For Future Growth
